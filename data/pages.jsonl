The college and the faculty has furnished a full-fledged support in whatever way it could and even in all the initiatives taken by us. This was more than what we could have expected from a college for its student fraternity. The employers nowadays are looking for candidates with positive attitude and aptitude rather than big names in the background. What matters is 'How you do it' rather than 'What you do'.

When I reflect on my four years in GLAITM and now GLA University in the BE Computer Science program, it is a no brainer that the experience not only gave me technical skills, but also prepared me in unpredictable ways for my career. My four years in GLA University have played a central role in my work and career. Apart from the technical skill that I learnt, the ability to collaborate in the face of conflict, logical mindset which is vital to decision making, planning, and powerful communication was encouraged and drilled into each one of us. These attributes and skills come in handy at later stages of anybody’s career progression. I was lucky to have my roots built in a very welcoming yet rigorous, environment at GLA University where I found myself able to communicate, innovate, and collaborate in ways that enabled me to build a successful career in consulting practice, and eventually to move up in the corporate ladder to be part of management. In my current role as Director at Jombay, I work with Business Heads, CHRO's and CEO's of many organisations and I draw every day on the dispositions I developed during my time at GLA. It was a wonderful time in my life, and the best educational experience I've had.

Different research for UBA is presently carrying in this Centre. Unnat Bharat Abhiyan (UBA) is flagship programme of Ministry of Human Resource Development (HRD) that aims to enrich Rural India. Following are some highlights of the work done/work in progress under UBA 2.0 in this Centre are: Five nearby villages named Jait, Kunjera, Bhartiya, Deviatas and Ajhai was selected for the implementation of UBA project. Detailed field surveys as well as general awareness camps were conducted in the adopted villages for promotion of organic farming to reduce the use of harmful pesticides and chemical fertilizers. Testing of farmers’ soil being done using DST Approved field testing Kits and provided them practical training for preparation of natural pesticides. For the preparation of pesticides, technology from National Council of Organic Farming (NCOF) under Ministry of Agriculture and Farmer’s Welfare was used. The soil of farmer’s field is being tested which helps the min creating‘ Soil Health Card’ and thus benificial in selling their agriculture product in good price. Sponsored Project: Unnat Bharat Abhiyan (UBA): Unnat Bharat Abhiyan is inspired by the vision of transformational change in rural development processes by leveraging knowledge institutions to help build the architecture of an Inclusive India. Two main researches going on in this Centre are: Vermicompost prepration using \"Jai Gopal\" Earth worm species: An indigenous highly resistant variety of earthworm was developed by Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI)-ICAR, Bareilly. The new indigenous species of earth worm named ‘JaiGopal’ (Perionyx Ceylanesis) is being used to prepare organic fertilizer to be applied on land in place of chemical fertilizers like Urea, DAP etc. Development of Organic Pesticides: There is a problem of soil salinity in this region due to presence of excessive salts present in the soil. Reclamation of soil salinity is needed by using some technique and thus making the soil more fertile and thus more suitable for growing crops. A Model Organic farm is being developed in two acres of land in Vrindavan forgiving practical training to farmers in the Mathura District in collaboration with an NGO. Academic Projects: B.

A complete blood count includes red blood cell (RBC), white blood cell (WBC), hemoglobin, and platelet counts, as well as hematocrit levels. Other analyses include mean corpuscular hemoglobin, WBC differential count in percentage and absolute value, Platelet distribution width, large platelet cell ratio, and Platelet criteria. Gel Documentation Systems from Bio-Rad A gel doc, also known as a gel documentation system, gel image system or gel imager, refers to equipment widely used in molecular biology laboratories for the imaging and documentation of nucleic acid and protein suspended within polyacrylamide or agarose gels. These gels are typically stained with ethidium bromide or other nucleic acid stains such as Gel Green. Generally, a gel doc includes an ultraviolet (UV) light transilluminator, a hood or a darkroom to shield external light sources and protect the user from UV exposure, and a CMOS camera for image capturing. Bio-Rad offers a comprehensive range of imaging systems for the detection, quantization, and analysis of proteins and nucleic acids in gels and on membranes. These gel documentation systems have advanced software, providing rapid automated data acquisition, analysis, and validation.

MJ Mini Thermal Cycler The compact 48-well MJ Mini Thermal Cycler is a powerful, small-capacity, high-performance personal thermal cycler for conducting polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the classroom. The MJ Mini cycler offers thermal gradient technology so you can optimize reactions for maximum efficiency and accurate quantitation. Micro Plate Reader A microplate reader is a laboratory instrument that is used to measure chemical, biological or physical reactions, properties and analytes within the well of a microplate. A microplate consists of small wells in which separated reactions take place. These reactions convert the presence of an analyte or the progression of biochemical processes into optical signals. The microplate reader detects these signals and thus quantifies the parameter of interest. A microplate reader can handle up to 3456 samples in minutes or even seconds. A plate reader helps to minimize operational time and to save reagent costs, allowing researchers to dedicate more time to data analysis and generation of actionable insights. UV Transilluminator A ultra-violet (UV) transilluminator is a standard piece of equipment used in life science laboratories for visualization of target DNAs and proteins. The UV transilluminator works by emitting high levels of UV radiation through the viewing surface. The key application for a UV transilluminator is for visualization of DNA and protein agarose and polyacrylamide gels after electrophoresis. Gels can be directly placed onto the UV transilluminator; wavelength will vary on your particular application. Centrifuge Centrifuge machine is electronic equipment used for the separation of components in a sample mixture, such as a mixture of suspended solids or two or more immiscible liquids. The equipment is fixed at the axis of rotation and centrifugal forces cause the samples to separate such that the denser materials are settled below the lighter ones. The sample is contained in conical or round tubes, often referred as the centrifuge tubes, and placed within the rotor, in a balancing position, and covered with a lid to prevent spillage, and any accidents or disasters. The rpm (rotation per minute), i.e. centrifugal speed, the duration of rotation, the temperature can be adjusted, based on the sample requirement. Cooling Microfuge Cooling Microfuge Model CM-12 is ideal for temperature sensitive samples and finds application for growing RIA (Radio Immune Assay demands), can be used for routine application in biochemical and clinical labs. For Hematocrit, Corpuscle Percentage contents in blood, serum analysis and precipitate separation also.
