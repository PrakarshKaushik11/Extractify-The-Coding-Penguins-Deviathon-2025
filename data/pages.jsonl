In simple words, ML teaches the systems to think and understand like humans by learning from the data. Try our ongoing free course Data Science Skillup with weekly topic coverage, notes, daily quizzes and coding problems. Machine Learning is mainly divided into three core types: Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning along with two additional types, Semi-Supervised and Self-Supervised Learning. Supervised Learning : Trains models on labeled data to predict or classify new, unseen data. Unsupervised Learning : Finds patterns or groups in unlabeled data, like clustering or dimensionality reduction. Reinforcement Learning : Learns through trial and error to maximize rewards, ideal for decision-making tasks. Note: The following are not part of the original three core types of ML, but they have become increasingly important in real-world applications, especially in deep learning. Additional Types : Self-Supervised Learning : Self-supervised learning is often considered as a subset of unsupervised learning, but it has grown into its own field due to its success in training large-scale models. It generates its own labels from the data, without any manual labeling. Semi-Supervised Learning : This approach combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data. It’s useful when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming.

Supervised Learning There are many algorithms used in supervised learning each suited to different types of problems. Some of the most commonly used supervised learning algorithms are: 1. Linear Regression This is one of the simplest ways to predict numbers using a straight line. It helps find the relationship between input and output. Introduction to Linear Regression Gradient Descent in Linear Regression Multiple Linear Regression 2. Logistic Regression Used when the output is a \"yes or no\" type answer. It helps in predicting categories like pass/fail or spam/not spam. Understanding Logistic Regression Cost function in Logistic Regression 3. Decision Trees A model that makes decisions by asking a series of simple questions, like a flowchart. Easy to understand and use. Decision Tree in Machine Learning Types of Decision tree algorithms Decision Tree - Regression (Implementation) Decision tree - Classification (Implementation) 4. Support Vector Machines (SVM) A bit more advanced—it tries to draw the best line (or boundary) to separate different categories of data. Understanding SVMs SVM Hyperparameter Tuning - GridSearchCV Non-Linear SVM 5. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) This model looks at the closest data points (neighbors) to make predictions. Super simple and based on similarity. Introduction to KNN Decision Boundaries in K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 6. Naïve Bayes A quick and smart way to classify things based on probability. It works well for text and spam detection. Introduction to Naive Bayes Gaussian Naive Bayes Multinomial Naive Bayes Bernoulli Naive Bayes Complement Naive Bayes 7. Random Forest (Bagging Algorithm) A powerful model that builds lots of decision trees and combines them for better accuracy and stability. Introduction to Random forest Random Forest Classifier Random Forest Regression Hyperparameter Tuning in Random Forest Introduction to Ensemble Learning Ensemble learning combines multiple simple models to create a stronger, smarter model. There are mainly two types of ensemble learning: Bagging that combines multiple models trained independently. Boosting that builds models sequentially each correcting the errors of the previous one. Module 3: Unsupervised learning Unsupervised learning are again divided into three main categories based on their purpose: Clustering Association Rule Mining Dimensionality Reduction . Unsupervised learning 1. Clustering Clustering algorithms group data points into clusters based on their similarities or differences. Types of clustering algorithms are: Centroid-based Methods: K-Means clustering Elbow Method for optimal value of k in KMeans K-Means++ clustering K-Mode clustering Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) Clustering Distribution-based Methods : Gaussian mixture models Expectation-Maximization Algorithm Dirichlet process mixture models (DPMMs) Connectivity based methods: Hierarchical clustering Agglomerative Clustering Divisive clustering Affinity propagation Density Based methods: DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) OPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure) 2. Dimensionality Reduction Dimensionality reduction is used to simplify datasets by reducing the number of features while retaining the most important information. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) Independent Component Analysis (ICA) Isomap Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) 3. Association Rule Find patterns between items in large datasets typically in market basket analysis . Apriori algorithm Implementing apriori algorithm FP-Growth (Frequent Pattern-Growth) ECLAT (Equivalence Class Clustering and bottom-up Lattice Traversal) Module 4: Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement learning interacts with environment and learn from them based on rewards. Reinforcement Learning 1. Model-Based Methods These methods use a model of the environment to predict outcomes and help the agent plan actions by simulating potential results. Markov decision processes (MDPs) Bellman equation Value iteration algorithm Monte Carlo Tree Search 2. Model-Free Methods The agent learns directly from experience by interacting with the environment and adjusting its actions based on feedback. Q-Learning SARSA Monte Carlo Methods Reinforce Algorithm Actor-Critic Algorithm Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) Module 5: Semi Supervised Learning It uses a mix of labeled and unlabeled data making it helpful when labeling data is costly or it is very limited. Semi Supervised Learning Semi Supervised Classification Self-Training in Semi-Supervised Learning Few-shot learning in Machine Learning Module 6: Forecasting Models Forecasting models analyze past data to predict future trends, commonly used for time series problems like sales, demand or stock prices. ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters) Module 7: Deployment of ML Models The trained ML model must be integrated into an application or service to make its predictions accessible.

It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an application that works over the internet, i.e., websites. Basics of Web Development To better understand the foundation of web development, it is recommended to take a look at the concepts used in web development. Why Learn Web Development? Web Development Prerequisites Important Terminologies Do you wish to learn Web Development in a scheduled manner ? Try our ongoing free course Web Development Skillup with weekly topic coverage, notes, quizzes and practical projects. There are two major areas: Frontend and Backend which forms the backbone of web development each plays a crucial role in creating seamless, functional web experiences. Frontend Development In this module, we explore the core technologies that run in the user’s browser—the client side—including how web pages are structured, styled, and made interactive, building everything users see and interact with. HTML (HyperText Markup Language): HTML is the language used to create the basic structure and content of web pages. It uses elements, tags, and attributes to organize text, images, and links. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is used to style the HTML content. It controls colors, fonts, layouts, and how the page looks on different devicesMore importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page. JS (JavaScript): JavaScript adds life to web pages by making them interactive. It handles things like buttons, animations, and form checks. Backend Development: In this module, we will explore the technologies that work behind the scenes on the server to handle data, run the website, and store information . Server-Side Programming Languages In Backend Development, Server-side programming languages are used to write code that runs on the server, not in the user’s browser. This server-side scripting handles tasks like processing data, managing databases, and controlling how the website works behind the scenes Below are some popular languages used to build the back end of web applications: JavaScript/Node.js: JavaScript is a popular programming language mainly used to add interactivity on the client side (in browsers). With Node.js, JavaScript can also run on the server side. Node.js is an open-source environment that allows JavaScript to build fast, scalable back-end services like APIs. Many big companies like PayPal, Uber, and Netflix use Node.js for their server-side code. PHP: PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development. Since PHP code executed on the server-side, so it is called a server-side scripting language. Python: Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently. Ruby: An object-oriented programming language designed to be simple and natural to use. Ruby helps developers write clean and readable code. Java: Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages and platforms. It is highly scalable. Java components are easily available. Golang(Go): Golang is a procedural and statically typed programming language having the syntax similar to C programming language. Sometimes it is termed as Go Programming Language. C#: A modern, object-oriented language often used to build web applications on Microsoft platforms. Databases A database is where a website’s data like user's data, product's data are stored and organized. It is part of the backend (server side) that manages and keeps this information safe. Websites use databases to save and access information like user details, content, and transactions. Some databases organize data in tables (called relational databases, like MySQL), while others store data in flexible formats (called NoSQL databases, like MongoDB). There are basically two types of databases: 1. SQL/Relational Database A relational database stores data in tables, similar to a spreadsheet, where each table has rows and columns. The rows hold individual records, and the columns define the data attributes. Tables can be linked to each other through special keys, allowing related data to be connected. MySQL : MySQL is an open-source relational database management system that uses SQL for managing structured data. It’s known for its reliability, ease of use, and performance, widely used in web applications. Postgre SQL : PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database that supports advanced SQL features and complex queries. It handles structured data, ensures ACID compliance, and is known for its reliability and extensibility. 2. NoSQL Databases A NoSQL database stores data in a flexible, non-tabular format, unlike traditional relational databases. Instead of using tables with rows and columns, NoSQL databases might use documents, key-value pairs, wide-columns, or graphs to store data. This allows them to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data efficiently. They are designed to scale easily and manage big data applications. Mongodb : MongoDB is a NoSQL database storing data in JSON-like documents. It handles unstructured data, supports powerful queries, and scales easily across servers, making it popular for flexible, scalable applications. Cassandra : Apache Cassandra is an open-source NoSQL database that is used for handling big data. It has the capability to handle structure, semi-structured, and unstructured data. Redis : Redis is an in-memory NoSQL database known for its speed. It supports various data structures like strings, hashes, and lists, making it ideal for caching, real-time analytics, and messaging. Note: We use Database management systems help keep the data safe, organized, and easy to use. APIs and Data Exchange Formats During Website development, different software components and web applications constantly need to communicate and share information. For instance, the frontend of your web application (running in the user's browser) needs to get data from the backend (running on a server), or your application might need to fetch information from a third-party service like a weather provider or a payment gateway. This communication is made possible through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and standardized Data Formats. Data Exchange formate for API Communication: When applications communicate via APIs, they need a common, structured way to represent the data being exchanged. This is where data formats come in. Below are two common data formats used extensively in web development for API communication: JSON: JSON or JavaScript Object Notation is a format for structuring data. XML: Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. Version Control and Deployment Developing a web application involves more than just writing code. Two critical processes that ensure a smooth, organized, and reliable development workflow are Version Control and Deployment . Version control helps manage the evolution of your codebase, especially when working in teams, while deployment is the process of making your web application accessible to the world. Modern development practices tightly integrate these two concepts, often through automation. Graphics Graphical elements are one of the key feature of any webpage.
