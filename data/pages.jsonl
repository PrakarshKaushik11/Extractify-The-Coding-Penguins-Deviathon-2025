Faculty of Agricultural Sciences Home Department Details Agriculture and agro-based industries are the backbone of the Indian economy. With only 2.3% world geographical area and 4.2 % world water resources, we are able to provide food and nutritional security to 17% of the world population (1.3 billion Indians). Agriculture not only provides food, vegetables, milk, fruits and spices/medicine to our people, but it also provides raw materials for various industries (sugar, cotton, tea, rubber, coffee and jute). Prof. Professor And Dean HOD Message Several agricultural revolutions (green, white, blue, yellow etc.) have changed the status of India from food importing to food exporting (surplus state). We feel proud to be in world no.1 or no. 2 for several agricultural products. Agriculture (2018) employed more than 50% of the Indian work force and contributes 17-18% of the country’s Gross Domestic Product. Agriculture with its allied sectors has the potential to provide livelihood/ employment for numerous of the country’s youth, both in rural and urban areas. Agriculture graduates produced in India are of excellent quality due to rigorous on-farm training during their degree programme and serve at national and international level. The vision of scientific / precision agriculture in India, the agriculture sector will attract bright and energetic young people who can give wings to their dreams and serve humanity where it is needed the most. As we look for a sustainable future of agriculture, one thing is certain – knowledge will be a key resource and will be highly sought-after within India and around the world. Our challenge is to generate ideas that will benefit society and to educate and train people to work in the agricultural field, where they will be valued for their specialized knowledge and for their proficiency in research, communication and solutions. Our mission is to provide quality education and skills along with research, training and practical experience as per the demand of the growing global agricultural environment.
